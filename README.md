### **Event Prediction Event Processing and Tagging (EPT)**

The **Event Prediction Event Processing and Tagging (EPT)** repository is a core component of the **Log Events Monitoring and Prediction System**, responsible for transforming raw log data into a structured and enriched format. By applying parsing rules and metadata tagging, the EPT ensures downstream components receive clean and actionable log data.

---

### **Features**
- **Log Parsing**:
  - Converts unstructured log entries into a structured format (e.g., JSON).
  - Supports customizable parsing rules for different log formats.

- **Tagging and Enrichment**:
  - Adds metadata tags to logs based on user-defined rules and patterns.
  - Supports additional tagging for special events, user configurations, and operational requirements.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Detects and isolates malformed or corrupt logs.
  - Logs errors for troubleshooting while continuing to process valid entries.

- **Configurable and Extensible**:
  - Parsing and tagging rules can be customized through YAML configuration files.
  - Allows integration with external configuration sources, such as regex dictionaries.

- **Seamless Integration**:
  - Accepts logs from the **Log File Reader (LFR)** and forwards enriched logs to the **Event Sequence Model (ESM)**.
